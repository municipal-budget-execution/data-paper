## Replication package 

* MiDES: New Data and Facts from Local Procurement and Budget Execution in Brazil* 

### Overview

The code in this replication package constructs the analysis files from data provided by State Audit Courts (TCEs). One master Python file execute all programs, including the R master file.

### Requirements

* Access to Google Cloud Platform and the `basedosdados-dev` project.
* Python 3 (all packages are as of 2023-09-06)
* R Studio (all packages are as of 2023-09-06)

#### Runtime Requirements

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard 2023 machine: 8 minutes
